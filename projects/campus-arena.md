CampusArena is a website that I had involvement in working on for a group project where you are able to create and join tournaments to have fun competing with others. It is complete with tournament brackets, standings, and matches to inform everyone on how the events are going.

For how the website works, users are able to create tournament events by clicking "Create an Event" on the homepage, filling out the form on how they want their tournament to be like (IE. How many players, what type of game is being played, etc), and hitting "Create Event" to create their tournament. Users can also join events by going to the Public Events tab to check all of the events that are currently up, selecting an event that isn't full yet, and joining said event to be a part of the competition. These events are held on the date and time listed on them.

The program is made on Vercel using a PostgreSQL database.
