summary: "This was a time back in 12th grade when I got to code an RPG battle interface"
---

When I was in 12th grade, I was taking AP high school Computer Schence class. Within the third semester of said class, we had a project where we had to code an RPG battle on C++. I got to program things like adding save files, programming basic fighting mechanics including damage and healing outputs, and programs weapons and items in my game. It was known to have been the first time I got exposed to game development.
