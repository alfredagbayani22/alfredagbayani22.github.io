## Introduction

Ever since the start of the new decade in 2020, the idea of AI, something which has been thought about in the last century in both fiction and nonfiction, would become increasingly trending within the Software Engineering community. More specifically, the use of chatbots such as ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot have become increasingly popular due to the fact that they have helped people get work done faster through searching things on the internet as well as thinking deeply faster than a human as to how to get these tasks done. This is especially true when it comes to the role of AI within the education system, which has helped many students learn new things as they seek for help in what they need to do to get their work done fast. That said, I myself have used AI chatbots such as ChatGPT and GitHub Coopilot to get tasks done.
