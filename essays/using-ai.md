## Introduction

Ever since the start of the new decade in 2020, the idea of AI, something which has been thought about in the last century in both fiction and nonfiction, would become increasingly trending within the Software Engineering community. More specifically, the use of chatbots such as ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot have become increasingly popular due to the fact that they have helped people get work done faster through searching things on the internet as well as thinking deeply faster than a human as to how to get these tasks done. This is especially true when it comes to the role of AI within the education system, which has helped many students learn new things as they seek for help in what they need to do to get their work done fast. That said, I myself have used AI chatbots such as ChatGPT and GitHub Coopilot to get tasks done.

## My personal experience with AI

When it came to my personal experience with using AI, I pretty frequently used it whenever I needed to complete homework assignments for my classes. As someone who has been using AI for 2 years, I found it to be pretty useful from time to time. Of course, AI isn't perfect as it has sometimes led me to the wrong answers that I wasn't looking for either because it was computing incorrectly or because my prompts weren't specific enough. That said, as time went on, AI started to become a lot smarter than when I first started using it to the point where I am able to get more reliable answers from AI. For examples on how AI has helped me...

### Experience WODs e.g. E18



### In-class Practice WODs

Whenever I did the practice WODs, I would oftentimes rely on AI to generate a code within minutes 

### In-class WODs

Initially, when I started my very first WOD, I did it without using AI because I wanted to see how well I did by myself with what I know from coding. Unfortunately, due to my lack of coding skill and overconfidence, I ultimately ended up failing the first WOD due to how I wasn't able to finish it on time. By my second WOD, I ultimately considered using AI to help me with my WOD by copying the entire instructions and pasting them into the prompt and telling it to "follow these steps". As a result, I was actually able to complete my WOD and score a full 100 points, showing how useful AI is to me in terms of completing tasks very quickly on the fly. Of course, some inconveniences that came in the way were that some of the steps were in images instead of text, but they could easily be bypassed by copying the images themselves and showing them to the AI so it can still follow the steps from those images.

### Essays

I have never used AI to write an essay (Whethere it'd be in full or partial chunks of it) as it would be completely dishonest to have something do the work for me that doesn't reflect how I myself thought about doing these things. However, at times I did sometimes use Grammarly to check for grammatical errors in my essays so I can have a perfectly organized essay.

### Final project



### Learning a concept / tutorial



### Answering a question in class or in Discord



### Asking or answering a smart-question



### Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”



### Explaining code



### Writing code



### Documenting code



### Quality assurance e.g. “What’s wrong with this code <code here>” or “Fix the ESLint errors in <code here>”



### Other uses in ICS 314 not listed
