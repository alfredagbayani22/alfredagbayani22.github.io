When it comes to asking smart questions, it is important that these questions in themselves should be professional and qualitively clear, especially for someone taking software engineering. That being said, not every question asked is professional especially when it comes to following the rules of asking a smart question, so let's go over an example of what is a proper smart question, as well as an example of what is a dumb question (AKA a question that violates the rules to stop it from being smart).

## Smart Question Example

In [this question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/541920/multiple-line-code-example-in-javadoc-comment), the OP shows a code example that they want to add into their Javadoc comment for a method, to which they state that their problem is that whenever they put their code example into their Javadoc comment, it shows up in the Javadoc with no line breaks which makes it difficult to read. What makes this question smart is that the header is professional to the point and not very casual-sounding, the grammar is clear, meaningful, and easy to understand to the point where it has allowed 19 people to answer this question properly, it is being asked iin a percise and informative manner to the point where they decided to show exactly what their code is as well as their output, they describe their goal and not a step, and they are very explicit in asking their question as evident by how they want an example of a correct code format, among other things that make this question smart.
