When it comes to asking smart questions, it is important that these questions in themselves should be professional and qualitatively clear, especially for someone taking software engineering as that is meant to be a sign that they are not only mature people, but also serious people wanting serious answers to things they cannot understand. That being said, not every question asked is professional especially when it comes to following the rules of asking a smart question, so let's go over an example of what is a proper smart question, as well as an example of what is a dumb question (AKA a question that violates the rules to stop it from being smart).

## Smart Question Example

In [this question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/541920/multiple-line-code-example-in-javadoc-comment), the OP shows a code example that they want to add into their Javadoc comment for a method, to which they state that their problem is that whenever they put their code example into their Javadoc comment, it shows up in the Javadoc with no line breaks which makes it difficult to read. What makes this question smart is that the header is professional to the point and not very casual-sounding, the grammar is clear, meaningful, and easy to understand to the point where it has allowed 19 people to answer this question properly, it is being asked in a precise and informative manner to the point where they decided to show exactly what their code is as well as their output, they describe their goal and not a step, and they are very explicit in asking their question as evident by how they want an example of a correct code format, among other things that make this question smart.

## Dumb Question Example

In [this question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57735029/im-new-to-this-and-i-need-help-please-3), the OP shows a code while also proceeding to state their problem that when they run a command in their code, their bot in Discord would spam in response, with them also placing a Gyazo link to an image of their problem. What makes this question stupid is that the header is un-professional due to the fact that it never specifies what problem they have exactly and instead vaguely states that they need help, and on top of this, their grammar is somewhat off due to the fact that they forget to make the "i" in their header upper case, followed by an unnecessary and un-professional heart symbol "<3" to show how immature they are. Also, they never really state what their goal is, let alone asking any question stating how they should fix their code. The fact that this was a poorly formatted question was what led to the question being downvoted to -2 as well as causing the thread to be closed.

## Conclusion

From my experience in reading these questions on StackOverflow, I can conclude that when asking for questions in StackOverflow, these questions are supposed to be professional with a goal in a way that people are able to give you answers easier. Otherwise, making dumb questions only wastes the time of many people to the point where they wouldn't be interested in answering these questions.
