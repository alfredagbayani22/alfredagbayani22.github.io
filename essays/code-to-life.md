Software Engineering is a pretty nice field in computer science for someone studying in that field to get into, mostly because it can be customized to fit one's interests and goals in a way that can benefit them throughout life. However, when it comes to understanding the concept of software engineering, it's not as simple as someone trying to learn how to walk for the first time. Of course, it takes time to understand software engineering, and it all starts with forming our first building blocks.

## Interests

Obviously, if one ever gets into software engineering, they want to get into it for a dedicated reason. Take me for example, as I am someone who has been getting into technology since my elementary school years through browsing the computer and playing video games. I sparked interest in software engineering after hearing that it can not only be useful for customization, but as the world evolves from a technical standpoint to the point where you see new technical trends such as artifical intelligence going around (I am especially interested in wanting to learn the mechanics of artificial intelligence for my personal benefits), it's pretty easy to adapt to the evolving world by learning new things.

## Skills

With interests in software engineering formed, it's now time we talk about the skills and experiences I hope to develop. Not all of us start off perfectly, after all. For me, I wish to gain the skills to be able to code things in a way that I would make about a hundred lines of code every hour, and for that to happen, it is necessary for me to dedicate a great part of my time every day to train myself for that dream to happen. Of course, skills don't necesarrily be exclusive to coding, as they can also apply outside of coding in the form of trying to communicate properly with peers for the best teamwork in getting projects done, and that is certainly a skill I also want to obtain from this experience.

## Conclusion

If one couldn't tell already, when one is able to learn the basic concepts of software engineering given the time dedicated to fulfill their needs, it can help them adapt to the world with its versatility to create many endless possibilities on how these softwares can be formed. Thus, as I have my personal goals of wanting to become a better at coding, everyone should very much do the same in trying to reach their goals.
