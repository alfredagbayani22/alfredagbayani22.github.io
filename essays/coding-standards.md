Coding is a skill that many people who want to be developers learn if they ever want to get jobs in the computer business. However, when it comes to learn about coding standards, it can certainly be very strict, whether it comes to formatting or using/not using certain functions. It is said that certain coding standards can help you learn a new language according to many developers. For me, I am personally with them about this statement.

## My Personal Experience With Coding Standards

When it came to my personal experience with coding standards, it starts out as rough for me whenever I used a new programming language for the first time. It's no surprise that as time goes on, new programming languages are introduced that are much more modern and advanced than previous programming languages of the old era to the point where they can have different variables and function formatting requirements. As I learn a new programming language, I'm usually so used to doing only one programming language (For example, C++) that as I go on to do another programming language (For example, Java), the way variables are defined are noticeably different as some of them are exclusive to certain programming languages (For example, variables like let and var being exclusive to programming languages Typescript and variables like int being exclusive to programming languages like C and Java). As such, I find them difficult when I start using them for the first time. However, as I continue to fiddle around with said programming languages more often, I see that I am starting to get more used to them to the point where I can actually start to understand how these programming languages work whether its the variables they possess or the function formatting requirements. Of course, this includes extensions for certain coding softwares that can help make coding easier especially if they can work on different programming languages and not just one.

## My first week using ESLint on VSCode

Speaking of extensions, just recently, I was taught about ESLint on VSCode. ESLint is basically an extension that helps detect errors in files that the usual compiler cannot detect, whether it is syntax errors or logic problems. When I used ESLint for the first time, my first impressions were that it was pretty useful given how it can help me detect errors very easily by just saying one line in the terminal.

However, fixing the errors detected after running ESLint is like reading a textbook after buying it from a bookstore as a requirement for a class. The amount of errors that is detected through ESLint can be so much that it is straight up overwhelmingly painful trying to fix every error manually without trying to use an AI tool. I'm surprised that the regular compiler can't even detect these simple errors that ESLint can detect, as I thought that only the compiler was useful in finding errors. Though, this can be interpreted by the fact that compiling feels like old school while ESLint is new school; essentially, it is vintage VS modern. That being said, while I found it very frusturating in fixing the errors that ESLint was able to find that the regular compiler couldn't, ESLint truly serves its purpose as being advanced in its job, and I recommend that people should go try ESLint out if they haven't already.

DISCLAIMER: I did not use AI to write this essay.
