## Introduction

There's always an old saying that as time goes on, technology advances further with every century that passes. Since the last century, the concept of coding was discovered, and with its discovery would lead to the creation of many different coding languages and even websites that everyone would create with their heart's content. If it wasn't obvious, the concept of Software Engineering is something that must be experienced by someone who is interested in studying computer science as what it possesses is crucial for improving their coding experience. As a computer science major and a Software Engineering student, I have learned many things about Software Engineering that made me become better at coding.

## Coding Standards

When it came to me learning about coding standards, it was mainly about learning about new coding languages in general. To nobody's surprise, many new coding languages get introduced in the many decades to come thanks to technology advancing, and so, with a new coding language, we are bound to learn about it and meet the language's expectations through practicing doing codes with the language itself. As much as this is commonly done when trying to create web pages, there exist coding standards beyond web application development in the form of trying to create video games for various consoles as being able to handle data and implement algorithms to ensure that results can be replicated. Both of these instances especially have one thing in common that isn't just involving web application development: being that people are bound to collaborate with each other into getting their coding tasks done for projects that aren't related to web development.
