It should come to no surprise that every website is known to have its different design pattern just to appeal to everybody who visits the site based on their upmost needs.

Examples of these design patterns being used include static site generation that pre-renders pages at build time, server-side rendering which generates pages on each request, and API routes which makes building serverless functions directly within the application easiter. If you couldn't already tell, all of these design patterns have one thing in common: they are practices that actually benefit the websites thanks to improving their performance that causes faster loading times thanks to less data being used as well as how the components can be constantly reused to maintain consistency and reduce redundancy, hence why people use design patterns.
